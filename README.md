"## About the Scripts

findvid.py: This is one of my first Python scripts that I wrote. It allows you to search for a specific video title by modifying the code to include a parameter for inputting the title and matching it against the filenames of the video files.

findvid2.py: This version is an update from the previous one. It is designed to scan video files stored on multiple drives.

twitdown.py / twitdown2 / twitdown3.py: These scripts were intended to download videos from Twitter. However, as of writing this README, I haven't been able to complete them yet. There is still much more for me to learn and explore."
